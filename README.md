# Django Auto-Run Script

## Overview

This script automates the process of running a Django server and opening the Chrome browser to the specified URL (`localhost:8000`). It streamlines the development setup and makes it convenient for users to start working on their Django projects without manual intervention.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.11)
- Django (version 3.2.6)
- Google Chrome browser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neharix/djrun-code.git
    ```

2. Install `auto-py-to-exe`:

    ```bash
    pip install auto-py-to-exe
    ```

3. Run `auto-py-to-exe`:

    ```bash
    auto-py-to-exe
    ```

4. In the `auto-py-to-exe` GUI:

    - Load your script by clicking on "Browse Script" and selecting `djrun.py`.
    - Select the "One File" and "Console Based" options
    - Click on "Convert .py to .exe" to generate the executable.

5. Once the conversion is complete, you will find the executable file in the specified output directory.

You can now drop the generated `.exe` file into your Django project and run it to start the Django server and automatically open the Chrome browser.

Note: Ensure that the `auto-py-to-exe` tool is compatible with your Python version and environment.


## Usage

1. Execute the script as mentioned in the installation steps.

2. The Django development server will start, and Google Chrome will automatically open with the URL `localhost:8000`.

3. Start building your Django project!

## Customization

- You can modify the `djrun.py` script to customize the Django server settings or change the default browser.
